# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?
- **I struggled at first with not paying attention to the exact syntax and was utilizing '=' when I should have been using ':'. It also took a me a minute to figure out how to call a value under a specific key. After trying a bunch of different ways, I eventually figured it out and made note. Things started to click a lot more after that.**
- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?
- **At first, I was referring to the content on the Mod 0 website and saving screenshots in my notes folder on the desktop. I realised I wasn't remembering the content as well, so I decided to take written notes as I read through each segment. The act of writing it out helps to solidify in my memory. When working through practices, I take the code and send to myself in slack for future reference.**
- What are you noticing that you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?
- **I start with trying to solve with what I know first until about the 5 or 6th attempt. THEN, I resort to googling one concept at a time and plugging in where I think it may work. I just have to be careful of just looking at one issue at a time, otherwise I get lost going down a rabbit hole and end up being more confused.**
